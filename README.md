## About the ... Dev, Project, Scope. 🤔

Hey there! 👋 I'm Anthony (aka Auxfuse), a Frontend Developer and an avid open source hackathon enthusiast. I built this project as a structured approach to submitting your first, of hopefully many, Pull Requests to Open Source.

To learn more about me and follow my other work, click here 👉 [Auxfuse](https://github.com/auxfuse). One small tidbit about me, I love Emojis, they are so damn colorful and can really help to spice up a wall of text. 📃

It's common knowledge that the inner workings to Git are often the initial stumbling blocks to most people making their first Pull Request (PR) to a project. It can be frustrating, confusing and just a bit of an undertaking trying to get to grips with it.

In the last 18 months or so, (2020/2021), Hackathons became a regular routine of mine. Not because it was code/programming, but because it was an avenue for me to challenge myself. Not just with my code, but with my Social Skills, working in a team environment, working alone on tasks in a sprint, and you guessed it.....Version Control (especially with a team!). 🔀

This is a fundamental competency that most don't realise along their Coding journey. Because learning can be somewhat of a solo, lonely undertaking. The need to learn Version Control in a team is not a priority. You might learn how to create a repo, add to the staging area, commit, and push to same....but you wouldn't (or might not) have the opportunity to do all those things all at the same time as a few team members, with code conflicts, branches, forks, merges. You can see that this is starting to grow legs. 😅

## Important notice about Hacktoberfest 2022

🎃🌐💻

Hacktoberfest 2022 was a resounding success for this project and those who contributed to it. Thank you to everyone for giving up your time, energy, and skillsets to make this project what it is today.

This project was my first iteration of open source, and Hacktoberfest 2023 has an even bigger project with some flashy specs and functionality. Hope to see you there. 🤜

Take your time with this process. Rome wasn't built in a day... 🏛, (ugh, that term is a bit stale now 😂), and your competencies or skillsets won't either.

The steps outlined below will be IDE/Editor agnostic, but where possible this guide is centered towards guiding you to do particular tasks that should be global across many of the modern day IDEs/Editors.

There are two proposed streams to this project for the participant to throw their hands at, Basic and Intermediate. There is a plan in place to extend this to Advanced in the future.

### Project Streams 👇👇

Pick from the below to start your PR journey:

The [Basic](basic.md) stream for this project will enable the user to learn & demonstrate:

- Minimum knowledge required to submit a PR
  - Forking the main repo
  - Setting the upstream from their Fork back to the main repo
  - Cloning the Forked project to their local development IDE/Editor
  - Creating a branch from within the IDE/Editor using the Command Line Interface
- Adding to a JSON file following a pre-defined format
- Commiting work to their branch
- Creating a PR
- Completing the PR template
- Engaging with the nominated maintainers of the repo via the PR threads
- Having their PRs approved/decline or merged into the project

The [Intermediate](intermediate.md) stream for this project will enable the user to learn & demonstrate:

- HTML/CSS mini-creation which will be automatically linked to from the Landing Page.

  Sometimes, it's great to showcase your work in a directory like this. You never know who you might one day be sitting beside for work 🙂😀 So use this as an opportunity to create something bespoke and unique, showcasing your skills using HTML & CSS.

- Directory surfing and creating sub-directories
- Optional review and delve into the default files of the project where you will find Grid, Flexbox, Root variables, Fetch API, JSON etc. All of these are are done in vanilla languages, and this project is completely framework-LESS.

- [Jim Morel](https://github.com/JimLynx) - It's not a jeep! 😅 An inside joke between us both. Student, turned friend, and still quite possibly CI's biggest and greatest asset. 🤜
- The Project Maintainers, [Andrew Dempsey](https://github.com/andrewdempsey2018) & [John Doyle](https://github.com/aramantos). The boys! 👏 This project would not be possible without them.
